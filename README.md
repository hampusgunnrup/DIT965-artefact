## About
This is a game artefact, or rather a prototype, that is made for the investigation of how to teach OOP to children(ages 6-12).
The proposed game will be a collection of studied phenomena and already known theories about children's learning and game design.
Previous work that has inspired this research is Scratch, Alice and GreenFoot.

This project is build in the cloud9 online workspace, hence the logo and support for it.


## Instructions

1) Create a blank workspace(c9.io)

2) clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/soggan/DIT965-artefact.git

3) Press run button

5) In the console there will be a link to the webpage. Click it!

6) If you want to look at the Apache logs, check out ~/lib/apache2/log
